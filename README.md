📊 HR Analytics: Employee Attrition Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition patterns to identify key factors influencing workforce turnover. The objective is to understand why employees leave the organization and provide data-driven insights to improve retention strategies.
The project follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow using:
•	Python – Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
•	PostgreSQL – Business Analysis using SQL
•	Power BI – Interactive Dashboard Development
________________________________________
🗂 Dataset Summary
•	Total Employees: 1,470
•	Features: 30+ columns
•	Target Variable: Attrition
Key Attributes:
•	Demographics: Age, Gender, Marital Status
•	Job Details: Department, Job Role, Job Level
•	Compensation: Monthly Income, Salary Band
•	Experience: Years at Company, Years Since Last Promotion
•	Work Patterns: Overtime, Work-Life Balance
Attrition was converted into numeric format:
•	1 → Employee Left
•	0 → Employee Stayed
________________________________________
🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)
Key preprocessing steps:
•	Removed unnecessary columns (StandardHours, Over18, EmployeeNumber)
•	Converted Attrition to numeric (attrition_flag)
•	Created Salary Band (Low / Medium / High)
•	Created Tenure Group (0–2, 3–5, 6–10, 10+ years)
•	Checked and handled missing values
•	Exported cleaned dataset to PostgreSQL

🗄 SQL Business Analysis (PostgreSQL)
Answered key HR business questions:
1.	What is the overall attrition rate?
2.	Which department has the highest attrition?
3.	Does overtime increase attrition?
4.	Which salary band has the highest attrition?
5.	Does tenure affect attrition?
6.	Which job roles are high-risk?
7.	Is there a gender difference in attrition?
8.	Does marital status influence attrition?
9.	What is the average salary of employees who left?
10.	Does lack of promotion (3+ years) increase attrition?
